<h1>Refelction!</h1>
<ol>
  <li>One of the hardest things I've learned how to do in this class is uploading a json file onto my repositories. In order<br>
        to do this, we would create a promise like the one below. In line one, we define a new variable that uses d3.json<br>
        to upload a json file called myData. Then, in line 2 we create a way for users to know if the data has been successfully<br>
        uploaded. First, we create a function that will be executed if the json file is successfully uploaded, starting in line 3.<br>
        Within the success function, we use the d3.select tool to change the first header to say "Your data has arrived!" letting<br>
        the user know the success of the upload. And finally, we create an error function, starting in line 7, that also uses the<br>
        d3.select tool to change the first header to say "No data avaliable." letting the user know that the upload was unsuccessful.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <pre>
      1    var myPromise=d3.json("myData.json")
      2       myPromise.then(
      3       function(success)
      4        {
      5         d3.select("h1").text("Your data has arrived!")
      6        },
      7        function(error)
      8        {
      9         d3.select("h1").text("No data avaliable.")
      10       })
      </pre>
  </li>
  <li></li>
</ol>
